### 1. You are parsing a log file that contains three columns: a timestamp, an account number (a string), and a transaction amount (a number). You want to calculate the sum of all transaction amounts for each unique account number efficiently.
Which data structure should you use?

- A. A linked list
- B. A hash table
- C. A two-dimensional array
- D. A comma-separated string

### Ans: B

Overall explanation
Incorrect Answers:

A. A linked list

A linked list would not provide efficient lookup or insertion of account numbers. You would need to traverse the list to find the correct account number every time, resulting in an inefficient O(n) time complexity for each search or insertion.

C. A two-dimensional array

A two-dimensional array would also require you to search through the array to find the correct account number every time you want to update a transaction amount, leading to inefficient O(n) time complexity.

D. A comma-separated string

A comma-delimited string is not a practical data structure for performing arithmetic calculations or efficient lookups. It would require parsing the string every time you want to update or find a value.



Correct Answer:

B. A hash table

A hash table is the correct choice for this scenario. You can use the account numbers as keys and the sums of the transaction amounts as values. This allows for efficient O(1) average time complexity for both search and insertion, making it easy to keep track of the transaction sums for each account number.

### 2. How to build a container without using docker file?

Google Cloud supports buildpacks—an open-source technology that facilitates the rapid and effortless creation of secure, production-ready container images from source code, without needing a Dockerfile. https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/google-cloud-now-supports-buildpacks

### 3. Deploy the application in Cloud Run from source code?

Deploying from source code is possible in Cloud Run. You can deploy new services and new revisions directly from source code using a single gcloud CLI command, gcloud run deploy, with the --source flag.
